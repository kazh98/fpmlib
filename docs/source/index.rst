fpmlib: A Fork of Fixed Point Quasiconvex Subgradient Method
============================================================

This package provides an implementation of nonexpansive mappings for expressing the constraint sets to be solved by the `fixed point quasiconvex subgradient method <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221719307945>`_ as fixed point sets.

There exists the `original implementation <https://github.com/iiduka-researches/201811-kaz>`_, written by Kazuhiro Hishinuma and Hideaki Iiduka, of the fixed point quasiconvex subgradient method and nonexpansive mappings used by it.
However, this implementation provides the functions limited to what is needed for illustrating numerical examples in the original paper.
In contrast to it, this package provides wider functions and mappings for constructing a variety of nonexpansive mappings.
